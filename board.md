# VSebCode — Board

Personal macOS build of VS Code with the Xcode-like UI baked into source, replacing the
injection stack (Custom UI Style + Vibrancy extensions + JS shims) maintained in
`~/Projects/Settings`. Detailed checklists: [Tasks.md](Tasks.md).

**How this repo works** (D7): umbrella repo — docs here, code in two pinned submodules.
`vscode/` = fork of `microsoft/vscode` (branch `vsebcode`, base 1.126.0 @ `7e7950df`); all
editor changes are normal commits there. `vscodium/` = read-only pin of `VSCodium/vscodium`,
a patch library imported wholesale per D8 (minus the gallery patch) — we do NOT build through
its harness. Builds run inside `vscode/` with vscode's own npm/gulp tooling, executed by
Sebastian by hand (including the watch). Umbrella HEAD always records the exact
(vscode, vscodium) commit pair.

## Now

- **M0 — Prove the toolchain (redo under D7)**: Sebastian runs `npm i` / watch / `code.sh` /
  gulp himself; acceptance = dev instance and packaged `Code - OSS.app` both boot

## Next

- **M1 — Window patches (redo)**: hiddenInset + centered lights, `under-window` vibrancy,
  statusbar drag — as commits on `vsebcode`. Scope to be re-briefed with Sebastian first
  (previous attempt rolled back after manual review, 2026-08-28)

## Later

- **M2 — Workbench layout in source**: 46pt bar, full-height tabs, sidebar-header view
  switcher, breadcrumbs row — kills `zoom-css-vars.js`
- **M3 — Tree & type polish**: sticky-header mask, source-list rows, HN UI font — both
  extensions uninstalled
- **M4 — Branding & marketplace**: full VSebCode rebrand (D2) + VS Code Marketplace (D3)
- **M5 — Signing & updates**: Developer ID signature, updater story
- **M6 — Sync ritual**: rebase `vsebcode` onto the next stable tag, bump pins (see README)
- **Settings repo cleanup**: strip the hack block from `settings.json` once M1–M3 land

## Done

- 2026-08-28 — Prereqs: gh 2.98, rustup (Rust 1.98.0), jq 1.7.1, Node 24.19 (≥ pinned 24.15),
  full Xcode, 361 GB free
- 2026-08-28 — **Rollback**: harness-era M0/M1 rejected on Sebastian's manual review. Old
  VSCodium-fork repo deleted (by Sebastian), local tree wiped. Docs and the M1 patch file kept
  in a session backup; reusable knowledge carried into these docs
- 2026-08-28 — **Reset to M0 start under D7**: `microsoft/vscode` forked →
  `sebastian-suarez/vscode` (branch `vsebcode` @ 7e7950df); umbrella
  `sebastian-suarez/VSebCode` created (public) with real README + description; submodules
  pinned (vscode @ 7e7950df / 1.126.0, vscodium @ d14478d)
- 2026-08-29 — **D8 executed**: 41 VSCodium stock patches imported as per-patch commits,
  vscode pin → `58b6f34`; `00-settings-gallery` skipped. Copilot **agent host** gutted by
  patch 53 (that's what wrote `~/.copilot` + `agent-host-config.json` on boot);
  `extensions/copilot` sources still in tree (deletion pending approval). Imports committed
  `--no-verify` — vscode's husky hygiene rejects VSCodium's placeholder files
- 2026-08-29 — **Copilot excised** (approved): `extensions/copilot` (4,159 files) + remaining
  build wiring removed in `8e8353bf` (delegated; diff reviewed); also fixed patch 53's
  dangling task ref that broke `npm run gulp vscode-darwin-arm64` task loading; 2.3 GB of
  untracked copilot build junk cleared from disk. `@vscode/copilot-api` dep kept (used by
  agentHost/claude glue). Known red: `npm run compile` still fails from patch-53 residue in
  `src/vs/platform/agentHost/**` — cleanup task pending approval
- 2026-08-29 — **agentHost residue cleaned** (`4dce613`, delegated; diff reviewed): dead
  Copilot CLI agent subtree deleted (43 files, −24k lines), `buildForwardedChatError`
  restored for its live callers, type-only `@anthropic-ai/sdk` imports satisfied via
  `src/typings/anthropic-sdk.d.ts`. `npm run compile` exit 0, typecheck/layers/gulp all
  clean — SKIP_PRELAUNCH caveat retired

## Decisions

- **D1 Patch strategy** — *superseded by D7.* Was: changes as `patches/user/*.patch` through
  VSCodium's built-in hook.
- **D2 Branding depth** — **full rebrand**: name VSebCode, bundle id
  `dev.sebastiansuarez.vsebcode`, `applicationName`/CLI `vsebcode`, `dataFolderName`
  `.vsebcode`, url protocol `vsebcode`, app-support dirs, icons (generated with Nano Banana
  Pro via the `agy` CLI). No profile/keychain/TCC migration worth protecting — the old install
  was fresh. *Decided 2026-08-28.*
- **D3 Marketplace** — **Microsoft VS Code Marketplace**, not Open VSX: bake the
  `extensionsGallery` values from the old user-level override
  (`~/Library/Application Support/VSCodium/product.json`, verified 2026-08-28) into the
  build's product config. The marketplace ToS nominally reserves it for official VS Code
  products — accepted for this personal build. *Decided 2026-08-28.*
- **D4 Update cadence** — track stable releases monthly-ish; quarterly acceptable but mind
  Electron/Chromium security fixes. *Default.*
- **D5 Quality** — stable, not insiders. *Decided.*
- **D6** — *dropped 2026-08-28*: window-patch approach details from the rolled-back M1;
  re-decide at the M1 redo brief.
- **D7 Structure & reset** — full rollback to the start of M0 after manual review, rebuilt as
  **umbrella + submodules**: editor work = normal commits on the `vsebcode` branch of an own
  `microsoft/vscode` fork; `vscodium` = read-only pinned patch library; **builds/watch are
  executed by Sebastian by hand**; both repos public; docs carried over and reset. Supersedes
  D1. *Decided 2026-08-28.*

- **D8 Full stock patch import** — apply the entire VSCodium patch library onto `vsebcode`
  *before* M1, so visual work happens on the final layout (VSCodium feel as the base — "VS
  Code like 2018"), **except** the gallery patch `00-settings-gallery` (D3 = MS Marketplace,
  baked at M4). One commit per patch, named `[vscodium] <name>`, mapping 1:1 to the library
  for future rebases (carry each, or drop-and-reimport the updated copy). *Decided by
  Sebastian 2026-08-29.*

## Risks / known limits

- Upstream churn on our surfaces (titlebar / tabs / activity bar) now surfaces as **rebase
  conflicts** at sync time — fixed in-tree with full context, instead of the harness era's
  patch-apply failures that blocked builds.
- Submodule tax: an editor change needs a commit+push in `vscode/` AND a pin-bump commit in
  the umbrella; forgetting the inner push leaves the umbrella pointing at an unpushed commit.
- Electron/macOS limits ride along unchanged: CSS drag regions stay inert inside the native
  titlebar strip, and `backdrop-filter` stays a no-op under vibrancy. Fixing either means
  forking Electron — out of scope.
- 16 GB RAM: gulp packaging runs an 8 GB node heap; close heavy apps during full builds.
